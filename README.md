# react-photolabs
This fullstack web app was developed using ReactJs, ExpressJs, PostGresSQL, and NodeJs.

I was tasked with finishing Photolabs from a pre-made architecture where basic styling and layout had already been created. I was given the opportunity to display my skills with: API and JSON use, object manipulation, creating custom hooks, state management via useEffect, useContext, and useReducer, managing both a backend and frontend server to return API requests.


# Photolabs
PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to view photos in different contexts. By fetching photos from a preexisiting API.
