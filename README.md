# react-photolabs
This fullstack web app was developed using ReactJs, ExpressJs, PostGresSQL, and NodeJs.

I was tasked with finishing Photolabs from a pre-made architecture where basic styling and layout had already been created. I was given the opportunity to display my skills with: 

-API and JSON use
-Object manipulation
-Creating custom hooks 
-State management via useEffect, useContext, and useReducer
-Managing both a backend and frontend server
